Introduction
As part of the 8 week Code First Girls Data and SQL course, participants must complete a final project. Participants are to cover several concepts covered in class when completing their SQL code, but are free to select their project topic.

Problem Statement
For my project I wanted to look at how SQL can be used as a job searching tool. Today, searching for a role has become a tiresome task with multiple hoops to jump through and for many, thousands of applications to complete. Rejection after rejection can make the process feel pointless. However, some benefits exist in the data created by completing these application. These include having a better understanding of the market and insights on your preferences. SQL is a tool that can help us not only keep track of our progress, but allows to better analyze it!
